# Black Friday Sales Analysis

## About
Analysis of the Black Friday retail dataset (537,577 transactions). The goal was to explore customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and product/category contributions to revenue.

## Steps I Followed
- Cleaned and structured the dataset (handled missing values, checked datatypes)
- Engineered demographic features like age groups, marital status, city categories
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) across Age, Gender, Occupation, City_Category, and Product categories
- Visualized purchase distribution and relationships using pandas/matplotlib/seaborn
